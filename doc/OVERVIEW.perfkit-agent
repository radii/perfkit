             +------------------------------+    Clients can request subscriptions.  Listener
             |          PkaEncoder          |    will create them as necessary.  PkaSubscription
             |                              |    will manage the hard work for it.  Listener just
             |                              |    needs to ship the bytes off that subscription
             |       PkaSubscription        |    yields.
             |                              |
             |                              |    Subscription uses a PkaEncoder internally to
             +------------------------------+    encode samples and manifests into buffers.

             +------------------------------+    PkaChannel aggregates a series of data sources
             |          PkaChannel          |    together.  It can also spawn processes for you.
             +------------------------------+    It basically does the hard setup work.

There is some additional stuff worth noting.

pka-pipeline.c     - Global hooks to a majoring of the plumbing.
pka-plugins.c      - Manages plugins such as sources, listeners, and encoders.
pka-log.c          - Manages logging hooks.
pka-source-info.c  - Metadata about a source plugin.
pka-encoder-info.c - Metadata about an encoder plugin.
pka-spawn-info.c   - Information about how a process is spawned.
pka-config.c       - Access to the configuration file (agent.conf).

This is somewhat what the protocol buffer looks like.


  message ManifestColumn {
    required uint32 id   = 1;
    required uint32 type = 2;
    optional string name = 3;
  }

  enum Resolution {
  	PRECISE = 0;
  	MICROSECOND = 1;
  	MILLISECOND = 2;
  	SECOND = 3;
  	MINUTE = 4;
  	HOUR = 5;
  }

  message Manifest {
    optional int64 timestamp = 1;
    optional Resolution resolution = 2;
    optional int32 source = 3;
    repeated ManifestColumn columns = 4;
  }

  message Sample {
    optional uint32 source = 1;
    optional int64 reltime = 2;
    optional data buffer = 3;
  }
